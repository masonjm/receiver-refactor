# A Real World Refactoring Example

This is an extraction and recreation of a real world refactoring.
The code uses Capybara to replicate an internal database into a
third-party application by screen scraping and filling in forms.

View the commit log to see each refactor with an explanation of
what was changed and why.

NOTE: This code was extracted from an existing application and
slightly anonymized. It is not intended to be runnable in its
current state.
